<b>ncane.com</b> was created to do away with long and / or difficult-to-remember URLs, but it also allows you, the advertiser, to create targeted links for your specific audience for banner ads, e-mail and newsletter advertising, and Google AdWords.
<br><br>
Have you been frustrated because you can't track exactly which people clicked on which links to arrive at your site? With ncane.com, you can create a link for a specific page, and we'll track how many people have clicked on that link for you - in real time.
<br><br>
Not only that, but we'll let you customise the name of the link if you like. For example, you can use our built-in link generator to create a random alphanumeric link, or if you want an easier to remember link, we'll let you create something like "http://ncane.com/banner01" for your banner campaign.
<br><br>
Because <b>ncane.com</b> offers a permanent linking URL referral mechanism, your links have to be unique. That's a given. It's like your website URL and your email address. So if you try to make a link that already exists, <b>ncane.com</b> will let you know, and allow you to choose another one.
<br><br>
Our permanent URL referral mechanism means that your link is active forever. However, if your ad campaign is no longer in effect and you don't want to use the URL referrer, simply expire your link. <b>ncane.com</b> lets you turn your links on and off as you please. If the link has expired, all traffic will simply be diverted to our home page. If you want the link reactivated again, that's a simple process of un-expiring the link again.
